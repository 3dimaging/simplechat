However, when a petition to make special is granted, the new application is taken out of regular order and examined more quickly.</p><p>One of the most common reasons for requesting that your application be made “special” is that the trademark in your new application was the subject of a previous registration that was inadvertently cancelled or expired.   For the USPTO to grant the request to make special, the trademark in the new application must be identical to the trademark in the cancelled or expired registration, and the goods or services in the new application must be identical to or narrower than the goods or services in the cancelled or expired registration.  There are no fees associated with a request to make special for this reason.  </p><p>Other reasons to request that an application be made special include the existence of actual or threatened infringement, pending litigation, or the need for a registration as a basis for securing a foreign registration.  The fact that an applicant may be embarking on an advertising campaign is not a ground for granting a petition to make “special.  If basing your petition to make special on any of these reasons, you must pay a petition fee.  The fee is $250 when you file online through the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS). </p><p>File your petition to make special online through TEAS at <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-application-process/filing-online/petition-forms">https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-application-process/filing-online/petition-forms</a> .  Select form number 6 “Request to Make Special” if your request is based on a cancelled or expired registration.  Select form number 4 “Petition to Make Special” for all other reasons. </p>
  utter_Letter_of_Protest:
  - text: <p>Generally, you can give the USPTO information about a pending trademark that is similar to your trademark by either filing a letter of protest or an opposition to registration.</p><p>A letter of protest provides evidence to the USPTO about why a trademark in an application should not be registered.  You must file a letter of protest before<strong> </strong>the USPTO approves a mark for publication in the Official Gazette.</p><p>You can file a letter of protest if you believe a trademark in an application will cause confusion with your registered trademark or a trademark in your prior pending application (one that was filed before the application that you wish to challenge) or if there is some other reason you believe the trademark should not be registered.  You cannot file a letter of protest based solely on your belief that you were the first to use a trademark.</p><p>File a letter of protest via the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) at <a href="https://teas.uspto.gov/ccr/lop">https://teas.uspto.gov/ccr/lop</a> .  </p><p>The filing fee for a letter of protest is $50.</p><p>You can also file an opposition.  Anyone who may be harmed by a trademark’s registration may file an opposition.  Before a trademark is registered, the USPTO publishes it in the Official Gazette (OG) at <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/official-gazette/trademark-official-gazette-tmog">https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/official-gazette/trademark-official-gazette-tmog</a> , a weekly publication of trademarks the USPTO has examined and approved for publication.

  utter_When_to_file_a_letter_of_protest:
  - text: <p>Letters of protest should be filed as soon as possible and <strong>before </strong>the application about which you are concerned is approved for publication in the Official Gazette. Monitor the Trademark Status and Document Retrieval (TSDR) system to determine the status of the application at <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/">https://tsdr.uspto.gov/</a> . Enter the serial number in the box next to the text “US Serial, Registration, or Reference No.” and click the blue “Status” button. </p><p>Letters of protest filed before publication will be considered when the evidence is relevant, supports the ground(s) for refusal identified in the letter of protest and the submission otherwise complies with the requirements of the Trademark Rule governing letters of protest.  Letters of protest filed after publication only will be considered if the evidence included with the letter of protest establishes a prima facie case for refusal of registration on the identified ground(s), such that failure to issue a refusal or to make a requirement would likely result in issuance of a registration in violation of the Trademark Act or applicable rules, and the submission otherwise complies with the requirements of the Trademark Rule governing letters of protest.  Letters of protest filed 30 days after the date the application is published in the Official Gazette will not be considered.</p><p>File a letter of protest via the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) at <a href="https://teas.uspto.gov/ccr/lop">https://teas.uspto.gov/ccr/lop</a> .  </p><p>The filing fee for a letter of protest is $50.</p><p>Get more information on letters of protest on the USPTO website at <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademark/trademark-updates-and-announcements/letter-protest-practice-tip">https://www.uspto.gov/trademark/trademark-updates-and-announcements/letter-protest-practice-tip</a> .</p>
  utter_evidence_for_the_letter_of_protest:
  - text: <p>For a letter of protest to be considered, you must provide relevant factual, objective evidence why the application should not proceed to registration.  The letter of protest itself, and any arguments, will not be forwarded to the examining attorney, only the relevant evidence.</p><p>You must include an itemized index that identifies all documents you're using as evidence. The index must provide a concise, factual description of each category or form of evidence included. Include no more than 10 items of evidence for the specified reason selected in your letter of protest, and no more than a total of 75 pages of evidence. The index should be on plain paper and not identify the protestor or its representatives or contain any arguments or persuasive language.</p><p>If you believe there is a likelihood of confusion between your trademark and a pending application, you must have a prior federal registration or a prior pending application with the USPTO to file a letter of protest.  Your letter of protest should identify your registration number or application serial number.</p><p>If the goods and services in the pending application are not identical to the goods and services in your registration or application, you <strong>must</strong> submit objective third party evidence showing how the goods and services are related. Evidence may include advertisements showing that the relevant goods or services are advertised together or sold by the same manufacturer or actual copies of third party registrations showing that such goods/services come from the same source. If providing third-party registrations you must provide copies of the registration certificates or printouts from the USPTO database showing the current status of the registration; a mere list of the registrations or a copy of a search report is not sufficient. And all submitted registrations must be based on use of the trademark in commerce.</p><p>If the basis for your letter of protest is that the trademark is descriptive, you must submit evidence showing use of the term by others for the same goods or services in a descriptive manner, or excerpts from the dictionary showing the meaning of the trademark. A list of websites is not sufficient and a letter of protest merely including such a list will not be considered.  If you are submitting webpage evidence, the evidence must include the complete URL for the webpage and the date the webpage was accessed or published. </p><p>File a letter of protest via the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS) at <a href="https://teas.uspto.gov/ccr/lop">https://teas.uspto.gov/ccr/lop</a> .  </p><p>The filing fee for a letter of protest is $50.</p><p>Get more information on letters of protest on the USPTO website at <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademark/trademark-updates-and-announcements/letter-protest-practice-tip">https://www.uspto.gov/trademark/trademark-updates-and-announcements/letter-protest-practice-tip</a> .</p><p> </p><p><a id="_Toc59094764"></a></p>
